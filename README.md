# Nearest Centroid Classification

This repository is meant to describe another basic method of classification used in data science, which involves finding the centroid, and then categorizing unclassified points based on the nearest centroid.  If that doesn't make any sense to you (or it does!) then you should read the tutorials to see an implementation of it in R.  If all goes according to plan, I will add more that applies this work to geometric morphometric data and compares it to well-worn but more black-boxy versions of the same function.

**For now, check out the tutorial I've posted, and hopefully more will come soon.**
